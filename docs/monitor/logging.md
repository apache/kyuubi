# Monitoring Kyuubi - Logging System

Kyuubi uses [Apache Log4j2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) for logging since version v1.5.0. For versions v1.4.1 and below, it uses [Apache Log4j](https://logging.apache.org).

In general, there are mainly three components in the Kyuubi architecture that will produce component-oriented logs to help you trace breadcrumbs for SQL workloads against Kyuubi.

- Logs of Kyuubi Server
- Logs of Kyuubi Engines
- Operation logs

In addition, a Kyuubi deployment for production usually relies on some other external systems.
For example, both Kyuubi servers and engines will use [Apache Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) for service discovery.
The instructions for external system logging will not be included in this article.

## Logs of Kyuubi Server

Logs of Kyuubi Server show us the activities of the server instance including how it starts and stops, how it responds to client requests, etc.

### Configuring Server Logging

#### Basic Configurations

You can configure it by adding a `log4j2.xml` file in the `$KYUUBI_HOME/conf` directory.
One way to start is to make a copy of the existing `log4j2.xml.template` located there.

For example,

```shell
# cd $KYUUBI_HOME
cp conf/log4j2.xml.template conf/log4j2.xml
```

With or without the above step, by default the server logging will redirect the logs to a file named `kyuubi-${env:USER}-org.apache.kyuubi.server.KyuubiServer-${env:HOSTNAME}.out` under the directory of `$KYUUBI_HOME/logs`.

For example, you can easily find where the server log goes when starting a Kyuubi server from the console output.

```shell
$ export SPARK_HOME=/Users/kentyao/Downloads/spark/spark-3.2.0-bin-hadoop3.2
$ cd ~/svn-kyuubi/v1.3.1-incubating-rc0/apache-kyuubi-1.3.1-incubating-bin
$ bin/kyuubi start
```

```log

```

#### KYUUBI_LOG_DIR

You may also notice that there is an environment variable called `KYUUBI_LOG_DIR` in the above example.

`KYUUBI_LOG_DIR` determines into which folder we want to put our server log files.

For example, the below command will write the log files to `/Users/kentyao/tmp`.

```shell
$ mkdir /Users/kentyao/tmp
$ KYUUBI_LOG_DIR=/Users/kentyao/tmp bin/kyuubi start
```

```log
Starting org.apache.kyuubi.server.KyuubiServer, logging to /Users/kentyao/tmp/kyuubi-kentyao-org.apache.kyuubi.server.KyuubiServer-hulk.local.out
```

#### KYUUBI_MAX_LOG_FILES

`KYUUBI_MAX_LOG_FILES` controls how many log files will remain after a Kyuubi server reboots.

#### Custom Log4j2 Settings

Taking control of `$KYUUBI_HOME/conf/log4j2.xml` will also give us the ability of customizing server logging as we want.

For example, we can disable the console appender and enable the file appender like,

```xml
<Configuration status="INFO">
  <Appenders>
    <File name="fa" fileName="log/dummy.log">
      <PatternLayout pattern="%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} %p %c: %m%n%ex"/>
      <Filters>
        <RegexFilter regex=".*Thrift error occurred during processing of message.*" onMatch="DENY" onMismatch="NEUTRAL"/>
      </Filters>
    </File>
  </Appenders>
  <Loggers>
    <Root level="INFO">
      <AppenderRef ref="fa"/>
    </Root>
  </Loggers>
</Configuration>
```

Then everything goes to `log/dummy.log`.

#### Sending Structured Logs to Kafka

The Log4j2 has a built-in [KafkaAppender](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/appenders/message-queue.html#KafkaAppender)
which allows sending log messages to an Apache Kafka topic with a few configurations, and it also provides a built-in
[JSON Template Layout](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/json-template-layout.html) that supports encoding
`LogEvents` to structured JSON messages according to the structure described by the provided template.

For example, we can configure the Kyuubi server to send the structured logs to Kafka `ecs-json-logs` topic,

```xml
<Configuration status="INFO">
  <Appenders>
    <Kafka name="kafka" topic="ecs-json-logs" syncSend="false">
      <JsonTemplateLayout>
        <EventTemplateAdditionalField key="app" value="kyuubi"/>
        <EventTemplateAdditionalField key="cluster" value="kyuubi-cluster"/>
        <EventTemplateAdditionalField key="host" value="${hostName}"/>
      </JsonTemplateLayout>
      <Property name="bootstrap.servers" value="kafka-1:9092,kafka-2:9092,kafka-3:9092"/>
      <Property name="compression.type" value="gzip"/>
    </Kafka>
  </Appenders>
  <Loggers>
    <Root level="INFO">
      <AppenderRef ref="kafka"/>
    </Root>
  </Loggers>
</Configuration>
```

And each structured log message looks like,

```json
{
	"@timestamp": "2024-12-24T18:53:01.030Z",
	"ecs.version": "1.2.0",
	"log.level": "INFO",
	"message": "Service[KyuubiServer] is started.",
	"process.thread.name": "main",
	"log.logger": "org.apache.kyuubi.server.KyuubiServer",
	"app": "kyuubi",
	"cluster": "kyuubi-cluster",
	"host": "hadoop-master1.orb.local"
}
```

Note: this feature may require additional jars to work. Please read the Log4j2 docs and ensure those jars are
on the Kyuubi server's classpath before enabling it.

## Logs of Spark SQL Engine

Spark SQL Engine is one type of Kyuubi Engines and also a typical Spark application.
Thus, its logs mainly contain the logs of a Spark Driver.
Meanwhile, it also includes how all the services of an engine start/stop, how it responds to incoming calls from Kyuubi servers, etc.

In general, when an exception occurs, we are able to find more information and clues in the engine's logs.

#### Configuring Engine Logging

Please refer to Apache Spark online documentation [Configuring Logging](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html#configuring-logging) for instructions.

#### Where to Find the Engine Log

The engine logs are located differently based on the deploy mode and the cluster manager.
When using local backend or `client` deploy mode for other cluster managers, such as YARN, you can find the whole engine log in `$KYUUBI_WORK_DIR_ROOT/${session username}/kyuubi-spark-sql-engine.log.${num}`.
Different session users have different folders to group all live and historical engine logs.
Each engine will have exactly one engine log.
When using `cluster` deploy mode, the local engine logs only contain very little information, the main parts of engine logs are on the remote driver side, e.g. for YARN cluster, they are in ApplicationMasters' log.

## Logs of Flink SQL Engine

Flink SQL Engine is one type of Kyuubi Engines and also a typical Flink application.
Thus, its logs mainly contain the logs of a Flink JobManager and TaskManager.
Meanwhile, it also includes how all the services of an engine start/stop, how does it response the incoming calls from Kyuubi servers, etc.

In general, when an exception occurs, we are able to find more information and clues in the engine's logs.

#### Configuring Engine Logging

Please refer to Apache Flink online documentation [Configuring Logging](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/docs/deployment/advanced/logging) for instructions.

#### Where to Find the Engine Log

The engine logs are located differently based on the deploy mode and the cluster manager.
When using local backend or `client` deploy mode for other cluster managers, such as YARN, you can find the whole engine log in `$KYUUBI_WORK_DIR_ROOT/${session username}/kyuubi-flink-sql-engine.log.${num}`.
Different session users have different folders to group all live and historical engine logs.
Each engine will have exactly one engine log.
When using `cluster` deploy mode, the local engine logs only contain very little information, the main parts of engine logs are on the remote driver side, e.g. for YARN cluster, they are in ApplicationMasters' log.

## Operation Logs

Operation log will show how SQL queries are executed, such as query planning, execution, and statistic reports.

Operation logs can reveal directly to end-users how their queries are being executed on the server/engine-side, including some process-oriented information, and why their queries are slow or fail.

For example, when you, as an end-user, use `kyuubi-beeline` to connect a Kyuubi server and execute query like below:

```shell
kyuubi-beeline -u 'jdbc:kyuubi://10.242.189.214:2181/;serviceDiscoveryMode=zooKeeper;zooKeeperNamespace=kyuubi' -n kent -e 'select * from src;'
```

You will both get the final results and the corresponding operation logs telling you the journey of the query.

```log
0: jdbc:kyuubi://10.242.189.214:2181/> select * from src;
2021-10-27 17:00:19.399 INFO operation.ExecuteStatement: Processing kent's query[fb5f57d2-2b50-4a46-961b-3a5c6a2d2597]: INITIALIZED_STATE -> PENDING_STATE, statement: select * from src
