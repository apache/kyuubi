Clients
=======

This section aims to document the APIs, clients and tools for end-users who are not necessary to care about deployment at the kyuubi server side.

Kyuubi provides standards-based drivers for JDBC, and ODBC enabling developers to build database applications in their language of choice.

In addition, APIs like REST, Thrift, etc., allow developers to access kyuubi directly and flexibly.

.. note::
   When you try some of the examples in this section, make sure you have a available server.
