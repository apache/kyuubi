# no install runs before style check because it is expensive, we can skip build if style fails
# Well, sometimes when we introduce a new module, it may 'fail' the style check for missing
# dependency we just create for other module to inherit.
# We can ignore this failure and merge the PR, if we see the style check pass on the new module
# or via a local quick verification.
